- [ ] Interaction labels are properly positioned
- [ ] Bidirectional nature is clearly indicated
- [ ] Example usage is documented
- [ ] Line style scales appropriately with diagram size

## Dependencies

- At least one team type implementation (TT-002 through TT-005)

## Estimated Effort
Medium (2-3 days)
