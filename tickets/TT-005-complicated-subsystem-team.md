# TT-005: Implement Complicated-subsystem Team Shape and Styling

## Summary
Create the visual representation and styling for Complicated-subsystem teams in the PlantUML extension.

## Description
Implement the shape, styling, and visual elements for Complicated-subsystem teams, which handle complex components requiring deep expertise. The implementation should reflect their specialized nature.

## Tasks
1. Define Complicated-subsystem team shape
2. Implement team color scheme (#9C27B0)
3. Create complicated-subsystem team icon/sprite
4. Implement team label positioning
5. Add support for team descriptions
6. Create example usage

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complicated-subsystem teams can be created using `Team_Complicated()` macro
- [ ] Teams are displayed with correct shape and styling
- [ ] Color scheme matches specification (#9C27B0)
- [ ] Team name and description are properly displayed
- [ ] Icon/sprite is visible and properly positioned
- [ ] Example usage is documented
- [ ] Shape scales appropriately with content

## Dependencies
- TT-001: Basic PlantUML include file

## Estimated Effort
Medium (2-3 days)
