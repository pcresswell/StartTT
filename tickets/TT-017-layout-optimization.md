# TT-017: Implement Layout Optimizations

## Summary
Create and implement layout optimization algorithms for Team Topology diagrams.

## Description
Design and implement layout optimization features to ensure diagrams are well-organized, readable, and make efficient use of space while maintaining clear relationships between elements.

## Tasks
1. Implement automatic spacing algorithms
2. Create team alignment optimization
3. Implement interaction line routing
4. Add boundary placement optimization
5. Create layout presets for common patterns
6. Implement manual layout override options
7. Document layout system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automatic spacing between elements works correctly
- [ ] Teams are aligned logically based on relationships
- [ ] Interaction lines are routed efficiently
- [ ] Boundaries are placed optimally
- [ ] Layout presets are available for common patterns
- [ ] Manual overrides are possible when needed
- [ ] Layout system is documented
- [ ] Example diagrams showing different layouts

## Dependencies
- TT-001: Basic PlantUML include file
- TT-014: Team boundary calculations

## Estimated Effort
Large (3-4 days)
