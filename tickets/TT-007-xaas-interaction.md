- [ ] Line color matches specification (#757575)
- [ ] Service labels are properly positioned
- [ ] Service direction is clearly indicated
- [ ] Example usage is documented
- [ ] Line style scales appropriately with diagram size

## Dependencies
- TT-001: Basic PlantUML include file
- At least one team type implementation (TT-002 through TT-005)

## Estimated Effort
Medium (2-3 days)
