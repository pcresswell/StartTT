# TT-011: Implement Team Icons and Sprites System

## Summary
Create and implement a system for team icons and sprites using PlantUML's sprite functionality.

## Description
Design and implement a comprehensive icon system for different team types using PlantUML sprites. This will provide visual differentiation between team types and improve diagram readability.

## Tasks
1. Design icons for each team type
2. Create PlantUML sprites for each icon
3. Implement sprite positioning system
4. Create sprite color variants for different themes
5. Implement sprite scaling functionality
6. Document sprite usage and customization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Each team type has a distinct icon
- [ ] Icons are implemented as PlantUML sprites
- [ ] Icons are properly positioned within team shapes
- [ ] Icons scale appropriately with diagram size
- [ ] Icons work with different color themes
- [ ] Documentation includes sprite customization guide

## Dependencies
- TT-001: Basic PlantUML include file
- TT-002 through TT-005: Team type implementations

## Estimated Effort
Medium (2-3 days)
