# TT-013: Implement Preprocessing Directives

## Summary
Create preprocessing directives for conditional rendering and advanced diagram features.

## Description
Implement a system of preprocessing directives that allow for conditional rendering, detail levels, and other advanced features in Team Topology diagrams.

## Tasks
1. Design preprocessing directive syntax
2. Implement conditional rendering system
3. Add detail level controls
4. Create zoom level support
5. Implement feature toggles
6. Add diagram metadata support
7. Create directive documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Preprocessing directives for conditional rendering
- [ ] Support for multiple detail levels
- [ ] Zoom level functionality
- [ ] Feature toggle system
- [ ] Metadata annotation support
- [ ] Clear documentation of all directives
- [ ] Example diagrams showing directive usage

## Dependencies
- TT-001: Basic PlantUML include file

## Estimated Effort
Large (3-4 days)
